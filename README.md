Hey there! This is the winning project for the "Community" category at the HackTheU hackathon. It uses the robinhood API to get trading history and uses the data to make trading decisions for multiple parallel-simulated models. Before you judge it *too* harshly, keep in mind some of this code was written at 4:00 am and I could barely even keep my eyes open. That said, I think it is a great start to an open source library that could allow this multi-model approach to Robinhood or trading in general.
